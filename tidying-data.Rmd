Read in data from [Mike Byerly. 2016. Alaska commercial salmon catches by management region (1886- 1997). urn:node:GOA. df35b.304.2.] (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/df35b.304.2).


```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```


```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  select(-All, -notesRegCode)

head(catch_df)

```

Move from wide to long format (using gather) and rename the catch column to reflect units


```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  gather(key = "species", value = "catch", -Region, -Year) %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)

unique(catch_df$species)
```

```{r}
catch_integers <- as.integer(catch_df$catch_thousands)

i <- which(is.na(catch_integers) == T)

catch_df$catch_thousands[i]

```



```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>%
  mutate(catch_thousands = ifelse(catch_thousands == "I", 1, catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch_thousands = as.integer(catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch = catch_thousands * 1000)

tail(catch_df)
```
